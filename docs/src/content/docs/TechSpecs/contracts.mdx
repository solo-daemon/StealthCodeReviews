## Smart Contracts Overview

The project utilizes several smart contracts to facilitate secure and transparent interactions. The contracts are written in Solidity and are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.


### 1. MockERC20.sol

This contract is a mock implementation of the ERC20 token standard, used for testing purposes.

### 2. ZKCodeReview.sol

This contract manages the code review process, including the creation and verification of zero-knowledge proofs.

### 3. ZkReviewDAO.sol

This contract governs the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) responsible for managing the code review process.
