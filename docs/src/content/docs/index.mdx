  tagline: We're reimagining bounty programs with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to protect contributors' intellectual property. Our framework enables contributors to prove the correctness of their submissions without revealing the underlying code. This ensures confidentiality, verifiability, and trust between contributors and verifiers.
